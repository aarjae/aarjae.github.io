#### Hey there buddy
I am Raaj, just a regular techie who loves to talk about tech all day long!.
I mostly spend time tweaking my Linux desktop, writing some Javascript and watching tech reviews. This blog will mostly be for the open source projects I work on, a few blog posts on how I get through on life and a few pictures I think are worth sharing :).

For now that's all I have to say, so grab yourself a cup of copffe and lets go on a nice roller coaster ride!
