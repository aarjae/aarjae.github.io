Ever wanted to use your device as a web server..?
Ever wanted to quickly show some work on your localhost to a team member somewhere on the planet and you were
forced to deploy your code to Heroku or some other free hosting?
Ngrok to the rescue!

Ngrok is basically a tool that allows you to turn your computer into a web server. All you need to do is
run it and provides with you with a public url you can use to access your localhost over the internet.
