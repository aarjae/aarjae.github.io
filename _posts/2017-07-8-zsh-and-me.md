Now we all know the power of the terminal. :simple_smile:

It's scary but once you get to understand it you love it(At least in my case). It arguably makes work faster though the GUI guys may argue otherwise. So I was checking out a video tutorial online and I saw the instructor using a really beautiful shell, like so beautiful. Well he said "For all those wondering I am using Zsh"...
Whooaa, now there goes me, straight to Google to search Zsh. I spent my free time reading about [Zsh](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Z_shell), why I would want to use Zsh and Oh my God(Zsh), those lovely themes!. Realized I could change themes and add plugins with a framework called [Oh-my-zsh]. 

Check out some themes :

So let's begin. I am on Linux so sadly I will only be able to provide a linux tutorial. If you are on Mac, I understand you can run the install with Hombrew. Sorry, but that's all I know...
First you install zsh from your distro's repos. If you are on Ubuntu, Debian or all the debian derivatives you can simply install by banging in this command

> sudo apt install zsh

If you are on Arch or Manjaro(I use Manjaro), you can simply install from the Arch User Repositories.
