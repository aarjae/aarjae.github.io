Okay stop right there. Stop thinking too hard.  So you've been hearing people talk about Linux all the time and you are confused. All you know is it's some weird Operating System only hackers use. Your friend told you its super difficult to use!. Some other Linux guy you met the other time told you how Linux is for only the 'nerdy' people, only the 'smartest techies'!...
Okay, none of the above is true, and I'm going to explain what Linux is and do some mythbusting. But first let's begin with a nice story...

Long time ago(Lol, it was just in the 1970s), there lived two really smart guys, Ken Thompson and Dennis Ritchie. They worked at Bell Labs(Today, you know Bell Labs as AT&T), a computer research center. They were working on a really big project called MULTICS. MULTICS is an abbreviation of a very long name we don't want to remember. Well, MULTICS was meant to be a very large computer that would rule all other computers, one computer to serve the whole United States, super right?
