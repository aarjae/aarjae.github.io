So I'm embarking on a journey to grasp React fundamentals and get comfortable with it in 7 days. This is my first time making use of a frontend framework at all and having to really use ES6 features predominantly in my code. I will be documenting everything I learn at the end of each day on this blog and also dump all of the code I write during the time on my [Github](https://github.com/raajable/theReactor). By the end of the 7 days I hope to feel at home in the React community and be able to build some cool Single Page Applications. Wish me luck!
